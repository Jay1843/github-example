Introduction: Business Problem 
RRBP (Really Really Rich Business People Incorporated) approached the data science team with worries over the current economic situation in our country. Their fears have motivated them to plan an emigration of their major business resources and assets to London, where a large portion of business is conducted. They have requested that we provide them with possible locations for their offices to move. They would prefer to all live within the same borough, and thus it would need to have an active out-of-home and night life (restaurants, bars, outdoor activities... etc) as well as be relatively safe and have access to good schools within the area. The distance to city center is not a concern as most of their meetings are virtual, with only a few being in person. They have requested a submission of no less than five borough possibilities.
